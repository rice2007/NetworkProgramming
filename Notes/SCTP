Stream Control Transmission Protocol
Combines TCP/IP with UDP
	Can start off with a UDP broadcast to find servers and switch to TCP for direct connections
		Gives new sockets
		Still uses SCTP model
One-to-One Model
	Just like TCP/IP
	Establishes a point-to-point connection
	Has own send and receive methods, but can use standard system calls
	Server Model
		Socket, bind, connect, accept, read, write just like TCP/IP
		Must worry about message boundaries	
One-to-Many
	Just like UDP
	Server
		socket, bind, listen, sctp_rcv, sctp_send as normal
		scpt_peeloff
			Says SCTP is using one-to-many but wants to use one-to-one
			Will create a new socket using the one-to-one model
				Must be executed on both sides
Message Boundaries
	Write and read are 1:1 needed.
	For every write called, there must be a read
		Compare to TCP where you can do 3 writes, 1 read, and receieve everything
	Whatever is sent from one side, the other side must be ready to read the stream of that many bytes
