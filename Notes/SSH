		stdin > SSH send > remote rcv > remote send > SSH rcv > stdout
		does not work in a single packet in, single packet out manner
		if both attempt to read, deadlock
	Solution
		system call select() - block until I can do IO
			nfds - 
			fd_set *restrict readfds - bit array (0 or 1) to tell if there is data (set null)
			fd_set *restrict writefds - (set null)
			fd_set *restrict errorfds - alerts of error (set null)
			timeout - gives a window for a response. will not read msg after timeout (set null)
		do a 

server has multiple descriptor that echo's whatever is read

C-Tip, when arg has * in front of it, it much have an & in front of it
