inetd
	listens on designated ports for traffic to open appropriate server program
	port must be defined in etc/services
	calls fork where child passes it to a given program
	if a port is bound to, inetd will not execute
		if port is free, inetd will forward it appropriately
	more efficient, because server executes only when needed and shuts down when completed
gateways
	machines on local network can directly message each other
	if no directly connected, machine must send to the default gateway
		default gateway will send to their default gateway (usually towards the outside of the network to the public) if they do not know address
		generally speaking, the more interior (closer to a local network) a machine, the larger the routing table
