MAC Address	
	Used to communicate within a network
	Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
		Hub can ask what nic has a specific IP
		NIC responds with the MAC matched to IP
	Encapsulation
		On outside network, router must send to the network hub
		Hub then finds specific machine MAC
	Broadcast
		All MAC interfaces will accept packets on broadcats FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF
		Broadcast address triggers an interrupt
			Under DHCP, its used on boot to request local IP

Conferences
	UPD
		Originator send connection to a hub. The hub can broadcast packets over network
		Would not discriminate between who wants packet and who doesn't
	Multicast
		Multicast MAC address - 00:01:5E:-:-:-
		"Subscription" based connection that sends packets once and duplicated where necessary
		Tells hubs that whenever a packet to multicast address is sent, forward it
		Anyone at any hop can join fater route is set up
